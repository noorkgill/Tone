# Tone
Provides Twitter users a tone breakdown of their tweets through data visualizations to bring awareness to online hate speech and reduce online harm.

An increasing trend in personal attacks on Twitter has created an environment on social media where others are targeted for their race, sexual orientation, disabilities, and much more. Platforms like Twitter try to identify potentially offensive content but struggle to distinguish between the types of personal attacks. 

Thus, many Twitter users online experience cyberbullying and participate in hate speech without knowing how it can harm others on social media. Through our research, we have found that providing a donut chart representation and breaking down the tone of their tweet will bring awareness to individuals about online hate speech and help reduce harm towards users. 

Our goal through this product is to promote empathy among Twitter users to reduce offensive content that harms the wellness of users. Through our product, we help encourage empathy among Twitter users, reduce targeting online, tackle society’s suicide rates and declining mental health, and make Twitter’s current stance on offensive content more comprehensive. Feel free to visit our resources page on our website to learn more about reducing offensive content and hate speech online.
